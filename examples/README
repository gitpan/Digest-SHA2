To use the Perl script, "hashfile", type:

        ./hashfile file1 [file2 file3 ...]

where file1, file2, file3, ... are the files you want to hash, e.g.,

        ./hashfile README resume.doc refman.pdf

hashfile takes at least one file as argument.

The Perl script, "strings", hashes different strings. The use of the
methods hashsize() and rounds() are also illustrated.

The Perl script, "clone" illustrates the use of the clone() method.
