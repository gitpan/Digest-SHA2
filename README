Digest::SHA2
============

SHA-2 is the collective name of one-way hash functions developed by the
NIST. SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 pertains to hashes whose outputs
are 256 bits, 384 bits and 512 bits, respectively.

This Perl implementation is meant to be a replacement for the older
SHA256 by Rafael R. Sevilla. His module has a bug in the SHA-256
implementation.

This new implementation uses the C source of Aaron Gifford.

BONUS

The C file, _sha2.c, is a standalone SHA-2 implementation. To
compile it, type:

        gcc -Wall _sha2.c

A new binary, a.out, will be created.

To run the binary, type:

        ./a.out

CAVEAT!!!

If you are using a C compiler that does not support 64-bit operations,
i.e., does not understand "long long" types, please comment out the
line

    'DEFINE' => '-DSHA2_USE_INTTYPES_H',

in the Makefile.PL.
